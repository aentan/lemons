The old logo although full of homemade goodness was too much like a geek hobby project.</p> <figure><img class=img-responsive src="../../assets/images/work/6degrees1.png"/></figure> <p>6degrees is named after the popular theory originally set out by Frigyes Karinthy and popularized by a play written by John Guare – <em>that everyone and everything is six or fewer steps away, by way of introduction, from any other person in the world</em>. This, in essence is what 6degrees is all about – to be a network of contacts where everyone is connected in some way.</p> <h3>Early Concepts</h3> <p>I started with metaballs to represent interconnected nodes within a network. I also tried making a telephone receiver look like a number 6. Then I tried to convey a 6 with a phonebook motif. A candidate that came close to being chosen and used was simply the refinement and recoloring (bottom right) of the original logo.</p> <figure><img class=img-responsive src="../../assets/images/work/6degrees5.png"/></figure> <p>I then moved to mathematical contructs to see if I have any non-arbitrary ways to represent 6 degrees of separation. Hexagons are great for this I thought.</p> <figure><img class=img-responsive src="../../assets/images/work/6degrees6.png"/></figure> <p>The hexagons and circles led me to the final concept. I decided the number 6 is the way to go, instead of spelling it out as <em>Six</em>. We can also avoid localization problems down the road.</p> <p>Instead of placing the degree symbol in an arbitrary position. I used the ascender of the 6 as the guide and placed it along the outer curve.</p> <figure><img class=img-responsive src="../../assets/images/work/6degrees2.png"/></figure> <p>The counter of the 6 is also placed in the same continuum as the ascender in a configuration similar to the <em>Large Hadron Collider</em> which accelerates protons from the smaller circle into the large circle.</p> <figure><img class=img-responsive src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Location_Large_Hadron_Collider.PNG"/></figure> <p>Being six-sided, the hexagon is the perfect polygon to communicate the concept of <em>six degrees of separation</em>. The hexagon is also one of the most efficient shapes in nature. Bees instinctinctively construct their hives as three-dimensional hexagons because they make for robust stuctures that cost the least wax. Since 6degrees is very much about maintaining a clean and efficient contact list, having a hexagonal frame makes sense.</p> <figure><img class=img-responsive src="../../assets/images/work/6degrees3.png"/></figure> <p>Graphite is made up of layers of graphene, each a single atom thick. In graphene carbon atoms are arranged in a hexagonal grid. Carbon nanotubes which are essentially rolled up tubes of graphene owe their strength to this hexagonal nature.</p> <p>Hexagons have internal angles of 720°. Each vertice is 120°. A hexagon can be sliced into six equilateral triangles. Each one can be half into two right-angle triangles. Overlaying the hexagon over the outer circle I broke it into twelve equal parts.</p> <figure><img class=img-responsive src="../../assets/images/work/6degrees4.png"/></figure> <p>The four equal segments of the top-left quadrant of the cake determines the the symmetry of the 6 and the distance from the terminal to the degree symbol. This manner of constructing the 6 feels stable and balanced. As a result the 6 despite being heavier on its left side stays in equilibrium because of its attachment to the degree symbol.</p> <p>Here’s the logo as a animated buildup to its final shapes showing the underlying geometry.</p> <figure><img class=img-responsive src="//d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/28163/screenshots/1443365/geometry.gif"/></figure> <p>Cornflower blue and a cyan shade was chosen to convey modern pastelecent aesthetic. The result is a bright and lively mark.
