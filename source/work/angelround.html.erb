    <p>A halo on the left to represent angel investors. A ring on the right to represent fundraising rounds entrepreneurs do. Connect them and you get what AngelRound is all about. Nothing more nothing less.</p>

    <p>The wordmark is set in HvD&rsquo;s <em>Brandon Text</em> bold. The overall form is a geometric one and thus pair well with a geometric typeface like Brandon. I chose Brandon over others like Futura because of its delicate rounded corners.</p>
    
    <p>Understated and restrained, the design avoids making itself pompous. By remaining consciously personable, the logo speaks about AngelRound&rsquo;s mission of helping entrepreneurs raise money from people they know and are close to, i.e. friends and family.</p>
    
    <p class="text-center"><span class="color-chip" style="background-color:#757AE9"><span>#757AE9</span></span></p>
    
    <p>The color violet inspires love and compassion. And also creativity &ndash; qualities found in angel investors and entrepreneurs.</p>
