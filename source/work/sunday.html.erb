    <p class="lead">The coronas of a midday sun swirling in deep Persian blue was designed for <a href="#" target="_blank"><em>Sunday</em></a> &ndash; a Singapore-based design studio set up by misfits.</p>
    
    <p class="by">Aen Tan</p>
    
    <p>My initial train of thought first led me to the analog approach and look to well-designed hand-lettered logos for inspiration. I experimented with a variety of ways to write each letter and see how well they would fit together.</p>

    <p>Then I began to explore other motifs such as sunrise and rectangles to see if they can better represent the sun than hand-lettering. Check out the middle finger too.</p>

    <p>Then I tried a more visual representation of the sun, drawing inspiration from pagan sun symbols like the one of <em>Cirque du Soleil</em>. I concluded with a more abstract approach and decided that instead of replicating a pagan sun face, I'd create coronas instead out of hand-drawn letters.</p>

    <p>The final corona mark is drawn with a single continuous stroke, much like a Japanese ens&#x14D; &ndash; another familiar circular symbol. While the ens&#x14D; signified minimalism, calmness and <em>mu</em> (emptiness), the corona mark communicated a sense of primordial energy &ndash; a positive opposite.</p>

    <p>I set the wordmark in <em>Soleil Bold</em>, primarily for the name of the typeface but also its relative thickness and contrasting angles, which balances it with the corona mark.</p>

    <p><em>Soleil Regular</em> is also used for headings while being paired with <em>Rooney Light</em> for body copy. I chose Rooney for its seriousness and also warmth. I would&rsquo;t want the sun to be surrounded by the cold of geometricals and grotesques!</p>
    
    <figure><%= image_tag '/assets/images/work/sunday-card.jpg', class: 'img-responsive' %></figure>
    
    <p>I also designed business cards. Again the theme here is warmth. Information is playfully arranged like sun rays radiating out from the corona mark. A nice side effect is there is no right way up for the card.</p>
    
    <p class="text-center"><span class="color-chip" style="background-color:#1c39bb"><span>Persian Blue</span></span> <span class="color-chip" style="background-color:#3b45ac"><span>Pantone 072 U</span></span></p>
    
    <p>Rich Persian blue was chosen to be a deliberate deviation from the usual yellow and orange used in solar symbols.</p>
